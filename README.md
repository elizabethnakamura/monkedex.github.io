🐒 Monkedex

An open, community-driven visual archive celebrating primates in media — film, television, video games, and digital worlds.
https://monkedex.github.io

📖 Overview

Monkedex is a browser-based tool for tracking every known primate appearance across pop culture.
It’s built with Vite + React (SWC) through Lovable, and stores user data locally —
a small menagerie that lives in your cache, not the cloud.

✨ Features

🧠 Local archive: Your sightings are saved to your browser’s local storage — private and portable.

🎥 Media metadata: Filter entries by species (chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, etc.) or format (film, TV, video game, digital art).

💾 CSV export: Download your collection or share your sightings with others.

🐾 No servers, no surveillance: Everything runs client-side.
